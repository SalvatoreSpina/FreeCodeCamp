      <p>
        If you have an interest in creating computer programs, mobile apps, websites, games or any other piece of software, you'll need to learn how to program.
      </p>      
      <ul>
        <li>Programs are created through the use of a programming language.</li>
        <li>This language allows the program to function with the machine it is running on, be it a computer, a mobile phone, or any other piece of hardware.</li>

    <header>Choosing a Language</header>
    <article>
      <p>Regardless of your decision, you may want to consider starting with one of the high-level, simpler languages. These languages are especially useful for beginners, as they teach basic concepts and thought processes that can apply to virtually any language.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
            The two most popular languages in this category are Python and Ruby. These are both object-oriented web application languages that use a very readable syntax.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Object-oriented" means that the language is built around the concepts of "objects", or collections of data, and their manipulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a concept that is used in many advanced programming languages such as C++, Java, Objective-C, and PHP.
        </li>

        If you're still not sure which language you should start learning, read through some tutorials for a few different languages. If one language makes a bit more sense than the others, try it out for a bit to see if it clicks.
      <code>Especially suggested languages: Python, Java, C, HTML (for web development).</code>

    <p>The first thing you should do when learning a new language is us learning the core of the language. While the parts of this step that apply will vary depending on the language you choose, all programming languages have fundamental concepts that are essential to building useful programs. Learning and mastering these concepts early will make it easier to solve problems and create powerful and efficient code. Exmaples:
        <code>Variables - A variable is a way to store and refer to changing pieces of data. Variables can be manipulated, and often have defined types such as "integers", "characters", and others, which determine the type of data that can be stored.</code>
        <code>Conditional Statements - A conditional statement is an action that is performed based on whether the statement is true or not. The most common form of a conditional statement is the "If-Then" statement. If the statement is true (e.g. x = 5) then one thing happens. If the statement is false (e.g. x != 5), then something else happens.</code>

        Many programming languages require compilers, which are programs designed to translate the code into a language that the machine can understand. Other languages, such as Python, use an interpreter which can execute the programs instantly without compiling.

        One of the first programs taught for any language is the "Hello World" program. This is a very simple program that displays the text "Hello, World" (or some variation), on the screen. This program teaches first-time programmers the syntax to create a basic, functioning program, as well as how to handle displaying output. By changing the text, you can learn how basic data is handled by the program.

        There are thousands of code examples online for virtually every programming languages. Use these examples to examine how various aspects of the language work and how different parts interact. Take bits and pieces from various examples to create your own programs.        <code>example</code>

    <header>Examine the syntax</header>
    <article>
      <p>The syntax is the way the language is written so that the compiler or interpreter can understand it. Each language has a unique syntax, though some elements may be shared across multiple languages. Learning the syntax is essential for learning how to program in the language, and is often what people think of when they think about computer programming. In reality, it is simply the foundation upon which more advanced concepts are built.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Make changes to your example programs and then test the result. By experimenting, you can learn what works and what doesn't much quicker than by reading a book or guide. Don't be afraid to break your program; learning to fix errors is a major part of any development process, and new things almost never work right the first time.</p>

    <article>
        When you're programming, you're invariably going to come across bugs. These are errors in the program, and can manifest virtually anywhere. Bugs can be harmless quirks in the program, or they can be major errors that keep the program from compiling or running. Hunting down and fixing these errors is a major process in the software development cycle, so get used to doing this early.
        <code>As you experiment with changing basic programs, you're going to come across things that don't work. Figuring out how to take a different approach is one of the most valuable skills you can have as a programmer.</code>

    <header>Comment all of your code</header>
    <article>
        Nearly all programming languages have a "comment" function that allows you to include text that is not processed by the interpreter or compiler. This allows you to leave short, but clear, human-language explanations of what the code does. This will not only help you remember what your code does in a large program, it is an essential practice in a collaborative environment, as it allows others to understand what your code is doing.

        Mastering a programming language takes time above all else. Even a simpler language like Python, which may only take a day or two to understand the basic syntax, takes lots of time to become truly proficient at. Like any other skill, practice is the key to becoming more proficient. Try to spend at least some time each day coding, even if it's only for an hour between work and dinner.      </p>

        Try to do things that you don't know how to do yet. Research ways to accomplish the task (or a similar one), and then try to implement that in your own program. Try to avoid being content with a program that "basically" works; do everything you can to make sure every aspect works flawlessly.
